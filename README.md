A simple jQuery-powered animation

#### Description
This is from a [jQuery lesson](https://github.com/Huntrr/jquery-demo). I've implemented it somewhat differently than the original, however, with stars and (predetermined but) differing speeds of planets.

Also an "extras" project under my blog, [TheHomeworkLife](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life)).

#### Features
- A sun centered using jQuery
- Planets moved using jQuery using trigonometry
- Randomly generated, "twinkling" and fading stars
- Animated planets going at speeds inversely proportional to their distance from the sun
- [Hunter Lightman](http://www.hunterlightman.com)'s icons. (Thanks, Hunter!)
